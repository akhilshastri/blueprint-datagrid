# Blueprint Datagrid

Blueprint Datagrid is an enhanced table component for [Blueprint 4](https://blueprintjs.com/). It adds features like paging, sorting, filtering and more to basic Blueprint tables.

### Status

Blueprint Datagrid is currently in active development. The development progress is being tracked in [this project](https://github.com/users/alex-c/projects/1).

## Why

Blueprint has two table components, the basic [HTMLTable](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#core/components/html-table), that provides Blueprint styling to native HTML tables, and the [Table](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#table) component, which allows to build highly interactive spreadsheet-like apps.

Blueprint Datagrid aims to hit the middle ground, wrapping the `HTMLTable` and adding common functionality like paging, sorting and filtering.
