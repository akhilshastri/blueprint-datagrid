# Blueprint Datagrid

Blueprint Datagrid is an enhanced table component for [Blueprint 4](https://blueprintjs.com/). It adds features like paging, sorting and filtering to basic Blueprint tables. Blueprint Datagrid is built with Blueprint components and styling and stays faithful to the look-and-feel of the library in both dark and light mode. It is written in and supports Typescript.

### Status

Blueprint Datagrid is currently in active development. Progress is being tracked in [this project](https://github.com/users/alex-c/projects/1). There is no version of Blueprint Datagrid released on NPM yet.

## Why

Blueprint has two table components, the basic [HTMLTable](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#core/components/html-table), that provides Blueprint styling to native HTML tables, and the [Table](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#table) component, which allows to build highly interactive spreadsheet-like apps. Blueprint Datagrid aims to hit the middle ground, wrapping the `HTMLTable` and adding common functionality like paging, sorting and filtering.
